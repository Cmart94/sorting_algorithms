# Sorting algorithms & Big O

This is a implementation of common sorting algotihms in C and clasified by Big O notation. In this repository you will find:
- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm
